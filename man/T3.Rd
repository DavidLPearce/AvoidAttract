\usage{
T3(
  data,
  speciesA,
  speciesB,
  species_col,
  datetime_col,
  site_col,
  unitTime = "hours"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The camera trapping dataset containing information on species, datetime, and site.}

\item{speciesA}{The first species in the interaction sequence.}

\item{speciesB}{The second species in the interaction sequence.}

\item{species_col}{The column name indicating the species in the dataset.}

\item{datetime_col}{The column name indicating the datetime of each detection.}

\item{site_col}{The column name indicating the camera site.}

\item{unitTime}{The unit of time used for calculating the time differences, default is "hours", options = c("secs", "mins", "hours").}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \describe{
    \item{total_summary}{A summary of the mean values for T3 across all sites that recorded an event and years.}
    \item{event_count}{The total count of T3 events across all sites and years.}
    \item{site_result}{A summary of the mean T3 values for each site that recorded an eventacross all years.}
    \item{detailed_result}{Detailed information on recorded T3 events, including site, year and time differences.}
  }
}
\description{
The T3 (AA) function analyzes camera trapping data to calculate the time between the detections of species A followed by species A without species B in between detections at each camera site for all years. The function returns the average of all T3 events for all sites and across all years, the number of times the event occurred, a site summary across all years and a detailed summary of each time the event occurred.

# Function Example. Note: DateTime column must be formatted as a date-time and not a character string!
T3_example <- T3(data = KScams_dat, speciesA = "White-Tailed Deer", speciesB = "Coyote",
                  species_col = "Common_name", datetime_col = "DateTime",
                  site_col = "Site", unitTime = "hours")
