Calculating the time between detections of species B to species A
}
\description{
The T2 (BA) function analyzes camera trapping data to calculate the time between the detections of species B followed by species A given that a T1 (AB) event occured at each camera site for all years. The function returns the average of all T2 events for all sites and across all years, the number of times the event occured, a site summary across all years and a detailed summary of each time the event occured.
}
\usage{
T2(data, speciesA, speciesB, species_col, datetime_col, site_col, unitTime = "hours")
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
The camera trapping dataset containing information on species, datetime, and site.
}
  \item{speciesA}{
The first species in the interaction sequence (preceding species).
}
  \item{speciesB}{
The second species in the interaction sequence.
}
  \item{species_col}{
The column name indicating the species in the dataset.
}
  \item{datetime_col}{
The column name indicating the datetime of each detection.
}
  \item{site_col}{
The column name indicating the camera site.
}
  \item{unitTime}{
The unit of time used for calculating the time differences, default is "hours", options = c("secs", "mins", "hours").
}
}
\value{
  A list containing:
  \item{total_summary}{
    A summary of the mean values for T2 across all sites and years.
  }
  \item{event_count}{
    The total count of T2 events across all sites and years.
  }
  \item{site_summary}{
    A summary of the mean T2 values for each site across all years.
  }
  \item{detailed_summary}{
    Detailed information on T2 events, including site, year, and time differences.
  }
