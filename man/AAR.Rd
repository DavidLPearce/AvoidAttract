Avoidance-Attraction Ratios (AAR)
}
\description{
The AAR function analyzes camera trapping data to calculate the average time intervals for interactions involving species A and species B. It calculates the average time for T1, T2, T3, and T4 events as well as the T2/T1 and T4/T3 ratios for each site summarized across all years and provides the total summary across all sites and years.

The T1 (AB) function analyzes camera trapping data to calculate the time between the detections of species A followed by species B.

The T2 (BA) function analyzes camera trapping data to calculate the time between the detections of species B followed by species A given that a T1 (AB) event occured.

The T3 (AA) function analyzes camera trapping data to calculate the time between the detections of species A followed by species A without species B inbetween detections.

The T4 (ABA) function analyzes camera trapping data to calculate the time between detections of species A, with a detection of species B inbetween the detections of species A.

The T2/T1 (BA/AB) ratio could be influenced both by the avoidance of the species A and the attraction of the species B

The T4/T3 (ABA/AA) ratio is influenced solely by the avoidance of the species B by the species A.

Values >1 for T2/T1 or T4/ T3 suggest nonrandom movement between the two species indicating that the species A is avoiding the area after the passage of a species B. Attraction of species B to species A could also result in high T2/T1 ratios, but would result in lower ratios of T4/T3.

  \item{datetime_col}{
The column name indicating the datetime of each detection.
}
  \item{site_col}{
The column name indicating the camera site.
}
  \item{unitTime}{
