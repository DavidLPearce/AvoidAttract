\title{
Calculating the time between detections of species A to species A with a detection of species B inbetween
}
\description{
The T4 (ABA) function analyzes camera trapping data to calculate the time between detections of species A, with a detection of species B inbetween the detections of species A at each camera site for all years. The function returns the average of all T4 events for all sites and across all years, the number of times the event occured, a site summary across all years and a detailed summary of each time the event occured.
}
\usage{
T4(data, speciesA, speciesB, species_col, datetime_col, site_col, unitTime = "hours")
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
The camera trapping dataset containing information on species, datetime, and site.
}
  \item{speciesA}{
The first species in the interaction sequence (preceding and succeeding species).
}
  \item{speciesB}{
The second species in the interaction sequence (intervening species).
}
  \item{species_col}{
The column name indicating the species in the dataset.
}
  \item{datetime_col}{
The column name indicating the datetime of each detection.
}
  \item{site_col}{
The column name indicating the camera site.
}
  \item{unitTime}{
The unit of time used for calculating the time differences, default is "hours", options = c("secs", "mins", "hours").
}
}
\value{
  A list containing:
  \item{total_summary}{
    A summary of the mean values for T4 across all sites and years.
  }
  \item{event_count}{
    The total count of T4 events across all sites and years.
  }
  \item{site_summary}{
    A summary of the mean T4 values for each site across all years.
  }
  \item{detailed_summary}{
    Detailed information on T4 events, including site, year, and time differences.
  }
