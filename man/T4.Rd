\title{
Calculating Time from Species A to Species A with Species B Intervening (T4 or ABA)
}
\description{
The T4 function analyzes camera trapping data to calculate the time between successive detections of species A, with species B appearing between the detections of species A at different camera sites. The primary focus is on calculating the time interval (T4) for each interaction. The function returns the average of all T4 events within a year for each site, every time that an interaction occurred (detailed_summary), the summary by year, and the total summary across all sites and years.
}
\usage{
T4(data, speciesA, speciesB, species_col, datetime_col, site_col, unitTime = "hours")
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
The camera trapping dataset containing information on species, datetime, and site.
}
  \item{speciesA}{
The first species in the interaction sequence (preceding and succeeding species).
}
  \item{speciesB}{
The second species in the interaction sequence (intervening species).
}
  \item{species_col}{
The column name indicating the species in the dataset.
}
  \item{datetime_col}{
The column name indicating the datetime of each detection.
}
  \item{site_col}{
The column name indicating the camera site.
}
  \item{unitTime}{
The unit of time used for calculating the time differences, default is "hours", options = c("secs", "mins", "hours").
}
}
\value{
  A list containing:
  \item{total_summary}{
    A summary of the mean values for T4 across all sites and years.
  }
  \item{event_count}{
    The total count of T4 events across all sites and years.
  }
  \item{site_summary}{
    A summary of the mean T4 values for each site across all years.
  }
  \item{detailed_summary}{
    Detailed information on T4 events, including site, year, and time differences.
  }
